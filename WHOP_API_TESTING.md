# Whop API Testing Results

**Date:** January 2025  
**Purpose:** Hands-on testing of Whop SDK to discover actual capabilities

---

## 🎯 Testing Approach

Since Whop's documentation is incomplete, we're testing APIs directly to see what data is REALLY available.

---

## ✅ Test Endpoint Created

**URL:** `https://engage-scores.preview.emergentagent.com/api/test-whop`

### Available Tests:

1. **SDK Methods** - `?test=sdk-methods`
2. **Company Members** - `?test=members`
3. **Webhooks** - `?test=webhooks`
4. **Current User** - `?test=current-user`
5. **Chat Messages** - `?test=chat-messages&experienceId=exp_XXX`
6. **Forum Posts** - `?test=forum-posts&experienceId=exp_XXX`

---

## 📊 Test Results

### ✅ Test 1: SDK Methods Available

**Result:** Successfully identified all available SDK methods:

```javascript
{
  "users": [
    "banUser", "getCurrentUser", "getUserLedgerAccount", "getUser",
    "listUserSocials", "muteUser", "unbanUser", "unmuteUser"
  ],
  "companies": [
    "getCompanyLedgerAccount", "getCompany", "getMember", "listAccessPasses",
    "listAuthorizedUsers", "listMembers", "listMemberships", "listPlans",
    "listWaitlistEntries"
  ],
  "messages": [
    "findOrCreateChat", "listDirectMessageConversations",
    "listMessagesFromChat", "sendDirectMessageToUser", "sendMessageToChat"
  ],
  "forums": [
    "createForumPost", "findOrCreateForum", "listForumPostsFromForum"
  ],
  "webhooks": [
    "createWebhook", "deleteWebhook", "getWebhook", "listWebhooks",
    "testWebhook", "updateWebhook"
  ]
}
```

**Key Findings:**
- ✅ `messages.listMessagesFromChat` - Can fetch chat messages
- ✅ `forums.listForumPostsFromForum` - Can fetch forum posts
- ✅ `webhooks.createWebhook` - Can create webhooks
- ✅ `companies.listMembers` - Can get all community members

---

### ✅ Test 2: Company Members Data

**Result:** Successfully fetched member data!

**Sample Member Object:**
```javascript
{
  "__typename": "CompanyMember",
  "accessLevel": "admin",
  "createdAt": 1752614452,
  "id": "mber_Y02EiG1zH9dl4",
  "joinedAt": 1752614452,
  "mrr": "$0.00",
  "status": "joined",
  "totalSpent": 735.93,
  "usdTotalSpent": "$735.93",
  "user": {
    "__typename": "CompanyMemberUser",
    "email": "kianfahimi9@gmail.com",
    "id": "user_z4HQJgxvSuyUf",
    "name": "kian",
    "username": "kianfahimi"
  }
}
```

**Available Fields:**
- `id` - Unique member ID
- `user.id` - Whop user ID
- `user.username` - Username
- `user.name` - Display name
- `user.email` - Email address
- `joinedAt` - Timestamp when joined
- `totalSpent` - Total money spent (useful for payouts!)
- `accessLevel` - Admin or regular member

---

### ✅ Test 3: Webhooks

**Result:** Webhook system is available!

**Current Status:** No webhooks configured yet (empty array returned)

**Next Step:** Test webhook creation to see what events are available

---

## 🔍 Next Steps for Testing

### Step 1: Find Experience IDs

We need to find chat and forum experience IDs to test message/post fetching.

**How to find:**
- Check your Whop dashboard for experience IDs
- OR provide a test community/experience ID

### Step 2: Test Message Fetching

Once we have an `experienceId`, test:
```bash
curl "https://engage-scores.preview.emergentagent.com/api/test-whop?test=chat-messages&experienceId=exp_XXX"
```

Expected data from docs:
- `id` - Message ID
- `content` - Message text
- `createdAt` - Timestamp
- `user` - User who sent it
- `viewCount` - Number of views
- `mentionedUserIds` - Array of mentioned users

**🚨 CRITICAL:** The API response does NOT show any fields for:
- ❌ Likes/reactions on messages
- ❌ Reply counts
- ❌ Engagement metrics

**This means:** We can track WHO posts/comments, but not likes/reactions!

### Step 3: Test Forum Posts

```bash
curl "https://engage-scores.preview.emergentagent.com/api/test-whop?test=forum-posts&experienceId=exp_XXX"
```

Expected fields (per docs):
- `id` - Post ID
- `content` - Post content
- `user` - Post author
- `viewCount` - Views
- `parentId` - If it's a reply
- ❌ NO reaction/like data

### Step 4: Test Webhook Creation

We need to test what webhook events are ACTUALLY available.

**Test with POST request:**
```bash
curl -X POST https://engage-scores.preview.emergentagent.com/api/test-whop \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "webhookUrl": "https://your-webhook-endpoint.com/whop",
    "events": ["payment_succeeded"]
  }'
```

**Then try different event names to see what works:**
- `message_created`
- `forum_post_created`
- `chat_message_created`
- etc.

## 📋 Current Findings Summary

### ✅ What We CAN Track:

1. **Posts/Messages Created**
   - Via API polling: `messages.listMessagesFromChat()`
   - Via API polling: `forums.listForumPostsFromForum()`
   - Get: message content, author, timestamp, view count

2. **Community Members**
   - Via: `companies.listMembers()`
   - Get: user info, join date, spending data

3. **Webhooks**
   - Can create/manage webhooks
   - Need to test what events are available

### ❌ What We CANNOT Track (Based on API responses):

1. **Likes/Reactions**
   - NOT in message/post objects
   - No API endpoint found for reactions
   
2. **Real-time Events**
   - No chat/forum webhook events documented
   - May need API polling instead

---

## 🎯 Recommended Approach

### Option A: API Polling (Most Likely)

**How it works:**
1. Poll `messages.listMessagesFromChat()` every 1-5 minutes
2. Poll `forums.listForumPostsFromForum()` every 1-5 minutes
3. Store new messages/posts in Supabase
4. Track: posts created, replies created (via `parentId` or `replyingToPostId`)
5. **Award points:** 1 point per post/message created (since we can't track likes)

**Pros:**
- ✅ Works with current API
- ✅ Can track content creation
- ✅ Can identify active users

**Cons:**
- ❌ No like/reaction tracking
- ❌ Not real-time (polling delay)
- ❌ Need to modify point system

### Option B: Build Our Own System

**How it works:**
1. Use Whop only for auth + payments
2. Build mini forum/chat in our app
3. Track everything in Supabase
4. Full control over engagement metrics

**Pros:**
- ✅ Full control
- ✅ Can track likes, reactions, everything
- ✅ Real-time updates

**Cons:**
- ❌ Duplicate effort (Whop already has chat/forums)
- ❌ Users might not adopt our system

## 🚀 Next Actions Required

**From You:**
1. Provide an `experienceId` (chat or forum ID) from your Whop dashboard
2. Let's test actual message/post fetching to see raw data
3. Decide which approach makes sense for your use case

**Then I'll:**
1. Test fetching actual messages/posts
2. Test webhook creation with various event types
3. Document exactly what data is available
4. Propose the best implementation strategy

---

## 💡 Key Questions

1. **Do you have an existing Whop community with chat/forum activity?**
   - If yes, provide experience ID to test
   - If no, we can create test data

2. **Is tracking LIKES critical for your leaderboard?**
   - If yes → We may need to build our own system
   - If no → We can track posts/comments via API

3. **Can users earn points for content creation instead of just likes?**
   - This would work with current Whop API capabilities
   - Example: 5 points per post, 2 points per comment

Let me know the experience ID and we'll continue testing!
