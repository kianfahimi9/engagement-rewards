# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"

## test_plan:
##   current_focus:
##     - "Task name 1"
##     - "Task name 2"
##   stuck_tasks:

##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

user_problem_statement: |
  Enhanced gamified point system for Whop community leaderboard. Added likes, poll votes, and improved reply tracking using Whop API directly. 
  
  New Point System:
  - Forum Posts: (views × 0.1) + (comments × 1) + (likes × 1) + (pinned ? 10 : 0)
  - Chat Messages: (replies × 0.5) + (reactions × 0.5) + (poll_votes × 0.5) + (pinned ? 10 : 0)
  
  Implementation includes:
  1. Added 3 new columns to posts table: likes_count, reply_count, poll_votes_count
  2. Updated point calculation functions to use engagement metrics from Whop API directly
  3. Updated sync service to fetch and store likes, reactions, poll votes from Whop API
  4. Updated UI components to display new point breakdown

    message: |
      Enhanced point system implementation complete. Key changes:
      
      1. Database: Added likes_count, reply_count, poll_votes_count columns to posts table
      2. Point calculations: Completely refactored to use direct API metrics instead of calculating from post arrays
      3. Sync service: Updated to extract engagement metrics directly from Whop API responses
      4. UI: Updated info cards to show new point breakdown
      
      CRITICAL TESTING AREAS:
      - Verify database migration applied successfully
      - Test forum post sync with real Whop data (check if API returns view_count, like_count, comment_count in snake_case)
      - Test chat message sync (verify reaction_counts and poll_votes arrays are being summed correctly)
      - Verify point calculations are working with new formula
      - Check that leaderboard updates correctly with new points
      
      AUTHENTICATION: Use existing Whop authentication flow - user should already be authenticated
      
      Please focus on backend API testing first, especially the sync endpoint to ensure Whop API integration is working correctly.
