The previous AI engineer's work focused on iterating a Whop community engagement leaderboard, initially streamlining to UI and Supabase, then integrating complex Whop APIs and payments. The core of this trajectory involved extensive debugging and refactoring to address Vercel deployment issues and ensure proper embedding within the Whop iframe. Key challenges included:  server-side rendering errors, Vercel's  misconfiguration due to  in , incorrect Vercel root directory settings, and GitHub author authentication conflicts with Vercel. The engineer systematically resolved these through dynamic rendering, root directory adjustments, and refactoring the Whop SDK integration to match a recommended example, culminating in a successful local build ready for deployment.

<product_requirements>
The user requested a gamified community engagement leaderboard for the Whop ecosystem, inspired by platforms like Skool. The goal is to incentivize organic engagement through points and Whop payment rewards, supporting multiple communities with unique identifiers. The application requires a main community leaderboard, a user's personal statistics page (earnings, level, streaks, rank, points), and an admin dashboard for prize pool management, payouts, and community analytics. The design must be mobile-optimized and Whop-branded. A Skool-like anti-spam point system based on forum post views (0.1 points) and replies (1 point), with lighter chat message tracking, was required. Community owners need to customize 10 level names. Payment integration is necessary for funding prize pools and disbursing rewards. Additionally, the app must deploy successfully to Vercel, gracefully display a message when accessed outside the Whop iframe, and specifically embed within Whop using a dynamic  path, following the integration patterns of the  example.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was focused on resolving critical Vercel deployment and Whop iframe embedding issues. The main problem involved a  during static generation of pages containing the , and a  error caused by  in  and misconfigured Vercel root directory settings. The user also explicitly requested the app dynamically open inside Whop using the  path, replicating the  example's approach.

The engineer addressed these by:
1.  Correcting the Vercel project's root directory to blank/ (from ).
2.  Removing  from .
3.  Refactoring  usage to handle the context consumer multiple children error by using a render prop pattern, and removing the intermediary  and  components.
4.  Implementing the dynamic  route, including a new ,  (server component), and  (client component), following the  example's architecture.
5.  Ultimately, the  static generation error was resolved by adding  to the root , , and the new  and .

The local build () is now succeeding, with all relevant routes correctly marked as dynamic. The  has been added to environment variables, and the webhook URL configured.

<optional_next_step>
Push the latest changes (with  rendering) from Claude Code to GitHub, and then verify the app loads correctly within Whop's iframe and the graceful fallback works when accessed directly.
