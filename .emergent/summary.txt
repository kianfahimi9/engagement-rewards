The previous AI engineer focused on building a Whop community engagement leaderboard with gamification, a point system, and Whop integration. Initial efforts involved thorough database schema design with s and multi-experience support. Significant progress was made on real-time data accuracy, especially for user statistics and leaderboard displays. Debugging involved Vercel deployment, dynamic data population, and synchronous updates. Key issues addressed included UI refinements, auto-sync, streak calculation, and admin access. The primary challenge was fixing point calculation in . This involved identifying an anti-spam filter blocking low-view posts and realizing replies weren't being fetched from the Whop API. Ultimately, it was discovered that a deprecated SDK ( v0.0.42) was being used, leading to an upgrade to . The immediate task concluded with the user requesting a comprehensive audit of all Whop SDK integrations using the newly available REST API documentation.

<product_requirements>
The product aims to build a Whop community engagement leaderboard inspired by Skool's gamification and Duolingo/Clash of Clans UI, fostering organic interaction and Whop payment rewards. Key features include tracking engagement (views, replies), enabling weekly prize pools by community owners, and supporting multiple communities. AI moderation was deferred. The UI consists of a main leaderboard (displaying level, rank, points, streaks, admin access), a personal statistics page (earnings, level, streaks, rank, total posts, activity), and an admin dashboard for prize pool management, payouts, analytics, and custom level names. The point system is  with anti-spam. Community owners can define 10 custom engagement levels. Critical requirements included dynamic community record creation and scalable data syncing. Admin access is restricted to the community owner. Display names are used over usernames. Chat replies are currently syncing and awarding points; forum replies are not yet correctly fetched or calculating points.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was actively debugging why forum posts were still not correctly accumulating points from replies, despite chat message replies working and points based on views being partially fixed (by lowering the anti-spam threshold). The logs confirmed that  was not returning reply posts for forums. Upon the user's discovery of new Whop API documentation, it was realized that the application was using a deprecated SDK version ( v0.0.42). An attempt to use  directly resulted in , confirming the SDK incompatibility. The new  was then installed via yarn install v1.22.22
