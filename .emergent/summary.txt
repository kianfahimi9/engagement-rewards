The trajectory details the refinement of a Whop community engagement leaderboard. Initial focus was on debugging point calculation () which revealed an outdated  SDK. Upgrading to  exposed further incompatibilities in authentication () and company context retrieval (). These were surgically fixed by adhering to new Whop API documentation, transitioning from environment variable workarounds to official  and  methods.

A significant challenge involved rectifying point calculation issues (anti-spam filters) and correctly syncing engagement metrics (likes, polls, replies) from the new API. A critical database oversight, storing decimal points in an  column, was identified and resolved by changing the column type to . Performance concerns led to implementing a simple caching mechanism with background sync for faster page loads. Finally, a comprehensive prize pool and payment system was built, incorporating Whop transfers and a checkout modal, completing the core features.

<product_requirements>
The product is a Whop community engagement leaderboard with gamification (levels, ranks, points, streaks) and payment rewards. It aims to foster organic interaction by tracking various engagement types. Key features include weekly prize pools (community owner-managed), multi-community support, and AI moderation (deferred).

**UI Components:**
*   Main Leaderboard: Displays level, rank, points, streaks, with admin access.
*   Personal Statistics Page: Shows earnings, level, streaks, rank, total posts, and activity breakdown.
*   Admin Dashboard: For prize pool management, payouts, analytics, and custom level names.

**Core Logic:**
*   **Point System:** Initially  with anti-spam. Expanded to include likes (1 point for forums, 0.5 for chat), poll votes (0.5 for chat), and a 10-point bonus for pinned posts. Forum posts are weighed heavier (1 pt per comment/like) than chat messages (0.5 pt per reply/reaction/poll vote).
*   **Levels:** 10 custom engagement levels definable by owners. Users must start at Level 1.
*   **Data Sync:** Dynamic community record creation and scalable data syncing from Whop API for forum posts and chat messages. Forum replies are now correctly fetched using  and chat engagement using  and .
*   **Admin Access:** Restricted to the community owner.
*   **Display:** Uses display names over usernames.
*   **Prize Pool & Payments (New Feature):** Community owners create prize pools (stored in DB with amount, period, end_date), which are funded from their Whop ledger. If balance is low, a Whop checkout modal appears. A payout button distributes funds to the top 10 leaderboard members (40% to 1st, then 18%, 12%, 8%, 6%, 5%, 4%, 3%, 2%, 2%).
*   **Performance:** Implement simple caching with background sync to reduce load times, checking for  to avoid immediate re-sync.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer completed the full integration of the prize pool and payment system. This involved:

1.  **Backend Logic:** A new file, , was created to handle Whop ledger balance retrieval,  for payouts, and the logic for distributing prize money to the top 10 winners (40% to 1st place, then 18%, 12%, 8%, 6%, 5%, 4%, 3%, 2%, 2%).
2.  **API Endpoints:** New API routes were added:
    *    (GET and POST) to fetch existing prize pools and allow the creation of new ones. This endpoint includes logic to check the company's Whop ledger balance and return a 402 status if funds are insufficient.
    *    (POST) to trigger the distribution of prize pool money to leaderboard winners.
3.  **Admin UI Integration:** The  component was completely rewritten to integrate with these new APIs. It now displays the company's available balance, provides a Create Prize Pool dialog (allowing input for amount, period, and end date), lists all prize pools with their statuses, and includes a Pay Out Winners button for active pools. Crucially, it integrates the Whop checkout modal to allow the community owner to deposit funds into their company ledger if their balance is too low when creating a prize pool.

The final action was the AI engineer providing a detailed summary of this payment system implementation, explicitly stating that the  permission needs to be added in the Whop dashboard and that real-world testing (especially for the checkout modal and end-to-end flow) is required.
